        <span class="title">Beyond: Two Souls</span> is an interactive drama action-adventure video game
        for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 home video game consoles,
        developed by Quantic Dream and published by Sony Computer Entertainment.
        It was released in October 2013. The game features <span class="cast">Jodie Holmes</span>, one of
        two player characters. The other is an incorporeal entity named <span class="cast">Aiden</span>: a
        separate soul linked to Jodie since birth. Jodie, who is portrayed by
        actress Ellen Page, possesses supernatural powers through her psychic
        link to Aiden, growing from adolescence to adulthood while learning to
        control Aiden and the powers they share. Willem Dafoe co-stars as <span class="cast">Nathan
         Dawkins</span>, a researcher in the Department of Paranormal Activity and
         Jodie's surrogate-father-figure. The actors in the game worked during
         the year-long project in Quantic Dream's Paris studio to perform on-set
          voice acting and motion-capture acting.
